The project involves creating a machine learning model for diagnosing malaria. The process included the following steps:

    Data Acquisition: Utilized a dataset from TensorFlow specifically for malaria diagnosis.
    Data Preparation: Split the dataset into three categories: training, testing, and validation.
    Model Training: Trained the model on the training dataset and evaluated its performance using the test and validation datasets.
    Accuracy: Achieved a high accuracy rate of 97%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in diagnosing malaria.

This approach ensures the model is well-trained, reliable, and capable of providing accurate diagnostic results.
